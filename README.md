# alexandria-beta
An open-source distributed library for sharing and preserving art, history and culture. Imagine a platform like Youtube, Soundcloud, or Netflix - without any of the costly server or bandwidth overhead. Users can self-publish anything, including videos, music, books, 3D-printables, recipes, and more. Content creators have complete control over how their work is published with several different monetization options. Only the publisher has the power to remove her/his content from the library.
