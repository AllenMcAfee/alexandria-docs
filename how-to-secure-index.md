####The DLOA's plan to secure it's library index
*by Devon Read*  

The Decentralized Library of Alexandria relies on three decentralized networks for it's core functions; the Bitcoin blockchain for direct payments to content creators, the IPFS DHT for hyper efficient p2p file distribution, and the Florincoin blockchain to store and retrieve the library's index. Bitcoin for payments and IPFS for file storage and distribution make sense to most users, but many have asked why we selected Florincoin for our library index, or more specifically, why we aren't using Bitcoin for that purpose. Their chief argument is that the Florincoin blockchain isn't anywhere near as secure from malicious attack as the Bitcoin blockchain. An attackable blockchain is a problem for two reasons: 1) the tx-comments in the Florincoin blockchain could potentially be altered, thus altering the information in Alexandria itself and 2) Florincoin transactions could be reversed, blocked from being allowed or altered in some other way, thus causing the miners and traders who's activity the blockchain rellies on to have their confidence in the coin's value shaken. 

#####So why don't we simply use the Bitcoin blockchain for Alexandria's library index, the undisputed king of hash rates (in fact, the incredible amount of mining power behind the Bitcoin blockchain actually makes it the worlds most powerful distributed computer), instead of a little known Scrypt *altcoin* with a relatively low hash current rate?   

To answer that question, first we must discuss how users will interact with Alexandria's library index. Most media distribution platforms rely on a centralized library index, stored in a large server farm somewhere, and accessed over http. The size of the database doesn't really matter too much, because it is only stored in servers which users interact with to look up the content they're looking for. However, doing so exposes users searching and browsing habits to that server's logs, and the company that owns it, and anyone else they chose to sell the info to. Since the user is forced to trust the results they get back when they ask the server to search its contents, they have no way to know if the returned results are actually complete, since all it takes to censor content is making some changes to the privately controlled database. In order to search, browse and publish content permissionlessly and without needing to trust any 3rd parties, one must use a decentralized database as the library index, which basically just means that users store the whole database locally and let it sync with other nodes to stay up to date so they can add new content to it and search and browse it privately. As it turns out, blockchain's make for pretty great decentralized databases in which users store them locally and rely on a brilliant combination of collaboration and competition to ensure that all nodes stay in sync with each other. But they're not exactly open databases, they're intended to store very specific data, transaction data - Bitcoin's blockchain is almost entirely made up of the ledger of all Bitcoin transactions since Jan 3, 2009. Florincoin was forked from Litecoin with the specific intent of creating a blockchain intended to store more than just transaction data by allowing users to include up to 528 bytes of information with a transaction, so simply by sending a transaction to one-self, a user can add 1/2kb of data to a permanent, decentralized database for just the cost of a Florincoin tx-fee (about $0.00015 right now).  However, Bitcoin has an... *unreported feature?* a *feature/bug?*... that allows it to function pretty similarly. The `OpReturn` function can be used to cram about 80 bytes of data into a Bitcoin transaction, and with this, we could theoretically use the Bitcoin blockchain as Alexandria's library index. So why don't we? Well, the Bitcoin blockchain takes more than 50GB to store whereas the Florincoin blockchain takes up about 1GB to store. Yes, both will continue to grow, and especially if Alexandria is succesful, it's index itself will grow quite large. But if we stored Alexandria's index in the Bitcoin blockchain, we would forever have that additional 50GB of data which is completely unrelated to our index, and it will only continue to grow. Remember, in order to publish, browse and search the Library index with the confidence that their searches are not being tracked and their results are not being altered or censored, users will need to store it locally. Storing all of the Bitcoin transactions that ever happen on their local hard drive should not be required in order to privately browse the Decentralized Library of Alexandria, so to us it makes more sense to keep the Alexandria index on a blockchain that isn't likely to be used primarily for transaction data.   

####Then how do we ensure that our selected blockchain is secure from attack?   

We have a plan. It requires a few components, so we'll start out by explaining each of them.  

Component 1 - The DLOA Florincoin Mining Pool   
Component 2 - The DLOA Scrypt Miner Rental Service  
Component 3 - Publishing with TradeBot
