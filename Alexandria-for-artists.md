####Alexandria’s secret plan to let artists do business directly with their audiences

Recently a spat played out on social media between Taylor Swift and Apple over its policy not to pay royalties to its artists during Apple Music’s initial few months - Taylor, representing independent musicians everywhere, wrote:

    Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those three months. I find it to be 
    shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company.

But she wasn’t calling for an artist boycott of the service, she was simply pushing for Apple to reconsider its position:

    it’s not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be 
    deeply and gravely affected by this. We don’t ask you for free iPhones. Please don’t ask us to provide 
    you with our music for no compensation.

Incredibly enough, in less than a day (on a Sunday and a holiday for that matter), Apple reversed its policy and let Taylor know over Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We hear you <a href="https://twitter.com/taylorswift13">@taylorswift13</a> and indie artists. Love, Apple</p>&mdash; Eddy Cue (@cue) <a href="https://twitter.com/cue/status/612824947342229504">June 22, 2015</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleMusic?src=hash">#AppleMusic</a> will pay artist for streaming, even during customer’s free trial period</p>&mdash; Eddy Cue (@cue) <a href="https://twitter.com/cue/status/612824775220555776">June 22, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

However, as a number of commentators have pointed out since the announcement, Apple’s ability to pivot on this decision so quickly suggests that it wasn’t a very expensive decision to make; that is, the cost to pay out those royalties isn’t even enough to justify waiting for a monday morning meeting. Apple is, after all, the most valuable company on the planet, with twice as much available cash in the bank as the US government. And while it has done incredible things to open up the digital arena for artists to sell their wares, it is still a corporation with an obligation to its shareholders to earn the highest profit margins it can - which necessarily means taking as big of a cut of the pie as it can from every sale it facilitates for its content-creators - apps, movies, music, etc. We think there is a better way.

####From software as a service to peers as a service   
Due to recent advances in decentralized networking technologies, It is now possible to replicate the publishing, distribution and sales services that Apple, Spotify, Youtube and similar media distribution services provide with open source code, replacing those companies’ servers, bandwidth and centrally-managed control with user-provided hard drive space, p2p file distribution mechanisms and direct artist control of content, and divide the pie only amongst those who directly contribute to the process. Let’s take a look at these piece one by one.

####Decentralized, permissionless publishing   
The first step for an artist to get their work out in the world in front of potential audiences is publishing it - that is, collecting all of the digital media files as well as the associated album liner notes, behind the scenes photos, tags and descriptive words that would help a potential fan discover them, and submitting it all to be included in a catalog. To publish to iTunes or Spotify, artists usually go through a middle-man service like CDBaby, which of course takes a small piece of their revenues in exchange for putting their tracks into digital music stores.

Alexandria handles this in a fully decentralized manner which eliminates central points of failure - we keep our ‘catalog’ in a distributed, peer to peer database in the cloud called a [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_(database)). You may have heard of it, or more likely you’ve heard of the first and most popular software to run on a blockchain, [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). For the uninitiated, Bitcoin is a digital token which allows its users to send any amount of value, from a micropayment of a fraction of a penny to millions of dollars, at nearly no cost, without relying on banks or governments to prevent fraud or ensure the money is properly transferred. To do this, it uses a decentralized, peer to peer collaborative ledger called the Blockchain - essentially a database kept on tens of thousands of users’ computers, which can only be added to by users following consensus-ensured rules. Because of how it is designed, any transaction which has been stored in it cannot be altered or removed later on, and it is extremely difficult (impossible in any practical sense) for one user to hack another user to steal their Bitcoins. But without a big and powerful institution like the US Government protecting it, how can the blockchain prevent fraud for it’s users and ensure that they can rely on it to move money around quickly and easily? Thanks to the ingenuity of [its mysterious creator](https://www.google.com/#q=who+is+satoshi+nakamoto), the collective efforts of hundreds of millions of dollars of hardware ensure that the rules are followed and that users are protected against fraud or theft. Because the whole system is built on open source software, anyone in the world can dig into the code to make sure that it is doing exactly what it claims to be doing - and because the blockchain is publicly visible, anyone in the world can ensure that the payments they make are going only to their intended recipients.

And how is it that a massive decentralized network can ensure that all of its participants are playing by the same rules to accomplish such a massive task you may ask? By aligning the individual profit motives of its users to accomplish that task - you see, all of the users who are working together to provide the clearing service and data security that Bitcoin relies on are actually competing with each other to win periodic pay outs of Bitcoins called the block reward, currently 25 Bitcoins every 10 minutes, or the equivalent of $6200 at Bitcoin’s current USD exchange price of $248. This network is running 24/7, so in total there is nearly $900k of Bitcoin block rewards available to be mined every day - this creates a lot of incentive, and the result is a highly secure network and database.

Alexandria uses Bitcoin to let artists receive tips and payments for their art directly from their audiences, with no centralized middle-men involved in the process at all. The platform also uses a fork of Bitcoin, Florincoin, to serve as the  library's distributed database. Remember, Bitcoin is open source software, which means that anyone in the world can copy its code base and tweak it so that it can do new things that Bitcoin could not. In the case of Florincoin, we get all of the same functionality that Bitcoin provides, but we also get 528 bytes of space in each transaction where we can store any information we’d like. Alexandria uses this space as its decentralized library index - in it can be found a list of all of Alexandria’s [publishers](http://54.172.28.195:41289/alexandria/v1/publisher/get/all), as well as all of the [artifacts](http://54.172.28.195:41289/alexandria/v1/media/get/all) they’ve published. An artifact is what we call the package of media files, descriptive info to help users discover the media, and the payment preferences of the Publishers - they can chose to give their art away for free but accept tips directly from users who enjoy it, or they can use a “Pay What You Want Wall” in which they set a minimum acceptable amount and any user who sends at least that amount will get access to their content. Over time Alexandria will be adding many additional payment options for Publishers, including a "subscription service" which is actually a pre-paid service - users decide how much they expect to spend over the course of a week or a month, their credit card is used to debit that amount, and various cryptocurrencies are metered out by the users consumption over the given time period - if they have a balance left over at the end, they can either elect to roll it over, or auto-tip all of the publishers who's content they consumed. We are also planning to include the option of using a cryptography enforced decentralized DRM mechanism. Florincoin uses the same incentive mechanism that Bitcoin does to make sure that miners are competing with each other to maintain its decentralized database, so there is a cost to publishing this information - each 528 byte message costs ¼ of a Florincoin to store in the blockchain - a fee paid to that network of miners. Most media submissions require 3-4 messages, so the total cost to publish any piece of media (a song, a feature film, a 3d printable piece of original art, a book, etc) is about 1 Florincoin, or the equivalent of about $0.002 currently. This will change over time as increasing demand for Florincoins (one of the most important aspects of blockchain based cryptocurrencies is that they have a known supply of coins and a set issuance rate, so if the number of users who have a need for them increases faster than its supply increases, its exchange price will be driven up by simple supply/demand economics) but Alexandria’s development team will adjust its publishing rules so that this cost is always very low (generally our target is less than $.10, but it will always be less than $1).

####Decentralized, peer to peer distribution   
Once a piece of art has been published to an online catalog, other users have the opportunity to browse and search the catalog to find it. But once they have, how do they get the file itself? In the iTunes/Spotify/YouTube model, the files are kept on a ‘content distribution network’ (CDN), paid for and controlled by various companies, and governed by their rules. Not only does this give these companies the ability to demand a big cut from artists revenues, but also the ability to remove or censor content they don’t agree with. To replace this with a decentralized mechanism, Alexandria uses the [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/) distributed hash table (DHT). Similar to the peer-to-peer technology underlying [BitTorrent](http://www.bittorrent.com/), IPFS is an open source software platform that allows its users the ability to share files with one another without going through any central points of failure. No matter how large a CDN’s data center is, or how much bandwidth they make available to their users, the fact that all of the data comes from a single source makes it innately less efficient than a DHT network. A service provider can spend a lot of money to make sure that their data centers are distributed around the world so that they are as close as possible to their users, and that they have enough available bandwidth to avoid slow-downs for popular downloads, but doing so is quite expensive, and of course they pass these costs on to the artists that use their platform. On the other hand, since DHT networks allow a user to download pieces of a file from any other use who has some of it, distribution traffic actually increases in efficiency as more users request a file, as illustrated in the below chart:
<div style="text-align:center" markdown="1">

</div>
For media that is innately popular, for example a song from Taylor Swift’s “1989”, the natural network effect caused by its organic popularity provides enough file storage space and bandwidth to drive its distribution cost down to an impressively low price: $0. That is, Taylor would not need to pay anyone anything to handle the actual digital distribution of her album.

Now what about other independent artists, those who are just releasing their first single or may have an established fanbase already, but not a very large one yet? Those publishers will have the opportunity to pay other users on an ongoing basis to “seed” their content, that is, to ensure that they have the digital files and that they are sharing them with any users who wish to enjoy the content. This is done without even requiring that the users being paid to provide this bandwidth have the whole file itself - perhaps 1000 users will have some pieces of the file, or perhaps 20 users will have the entire file - either way, the result is that anyone who comes along and wishes to enjoy that particular piece of art can stream it immediately. Because of the incredible efficiency of this mechanism, Alexandria’s musicians can share [FLAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC) (lossless audio) versions of their music, and filmmakers can share 1080p HD versions of their films, and end users can enjoy streaming playback of those files without needing to wait for buffering. The cost that publishers will pay to users who help seed their content will be market determined, but our projections suggest that it will be an extremely reasonable cost; for example, a feature film in 1080p HD should cost $2-3 per year, and a FLAC album should cost no more than $1 per year for enough seeding that it is always available to a new user to stream.

In some cases, a file may start out as extremely popular, and thus require no distribution incentives from its publisher, but over time it may become less popular - hey, its called “pop” music after-all, and tastes sure are fickle. In that case, if a user comes across a piece of media they’d like to download or stream, but they find that there simply isn’t enough “seeding” of the file happening to get it quickly, they can offer to pay other users who have it but aren’t currently sharing it - they pay a few cents worth of bitcoin and their download rate almost immediately picks up to full speed.

####The last piece of the puzzle is, of course, marketing and promotions   
While social media has actually largely supplanted the need for this service, allowing anyone the ability to promote their art however they’d like, there is still plenty of room for labels or even tech platforms like iTunes to give their artists some extra help getting their art in front of new users. It is our opinion that this has become a value-added service, which artists should be able to opt in or opt out of, and it should certainly not be used as justification for their labels or for tech companies to continue to demand the lion’s share of their revenues. Alexandria does not address this need yet, except in that everything in its library can be linked to and shared over social media, but we plan to create a new user class: “promoters” - another peer-to-peer mechanism in which users can evangelize a piece of art however they see fit, whether that’s over social media, print advertising or even sky writing, and can earn a portion of the revenues that result from their efforts.

####Bringing it all together   
Between these three technologies, Bitcoin, Florincoin and IPFS, Alexandria is able to replace the centralized mechanisms required for publishing, distribution and payments with an entirely peer to peer, uncensorable and un-corruptible processes. We also give users features like commenting on media, publisher subscriptions, the ability to automatically “cash out” their cryptocurrency tokens into USD or other fiat currencies, allowing Alexandria the ability to replace the “software as a service” model that runs platforms like iTunes, Spotify and YouTube with something entirely peer driven, in which only the artist has control of their content, only the artist gets paid by their audiences and only the artist gets to chose how they wish to split their revenues up with the other users that help them.
